## Kubernetes Field Manual (K8FM)

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), an open source project initially developed by Google under the name Borg, and currently maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), is one of the most popular container orchestration platforms in use today. Its flexibility and strong community make it a popular choice for developers, however, its complexity can often lead to security gaps. As with many modern technologies, finding the right balance between permitting fast paced development while maintaining effective security controls is an ever moving challenge.

Kubernetes is also known as K8s, (K - eight letters - s, pronounced 'Kay-Ates'), hence this Kubernets Filed Manual becomes K8FM, which aims to be the one stop spot to shop for all your Kubernetes security needs. Its primary audience is that of a security professional, who has been granted access to a Kubernetes cluster in order to perform a security assessment - what is sometimes referred to as a 'white-box' assessment. This should also be useful to Kubernetes developers who can use this manual review their own environments. Additionally, K8FM includes techniques such as container breakouts and lateral movement through a cluster, which should come in handy when access to the environment is not provided, e.g. an adversary simulation project, or even a CTF.
